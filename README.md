# Data-Professional-Survey-Breakdown-PowerBi-Project
## TASK
Analyze a survey on data professionals for breaking into a data role.

## TOOL
Power BI

## DESCRIPTION
The project starts with the survey answers collected by Alex Freberg, where the data source and the project idea came from, thanks to his amazing PowerBI course on YouTube.

Essentially, the analysis focuses on how data professionals got into their roles, an analysis of their demographics and salary levels, and how satisfied they are with their job in terms of work-life balance, salary, and other aspects.

The project covered the following areas:

1. Business and data understanding.
2. Data cleaning and transformations using Power query editor and DAX.
3. Building the data professional survey breakdown dashboard using PowerBI.
4. Getting insights!
